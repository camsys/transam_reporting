gemspec

# Declare any dependencies that are still in development here instead of in
# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.

# This gem allows us to share githooks. Githooks in the .hooks folder can be checked
# in, and when "bundle install" is run this gem automatically creates symlinks into
# your local .git/hooks. If you have pre-existing hooks in .git/hooks, it will move
# them to .git/hooks/old and you can move them back at your leisure. Any hooks
# checked in to .hooks will be shared among the team. If you need to re-generate
# the symlinks, you can use 'bundle exec git-hookshot'
